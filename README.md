## 1. About the Project


This project focuses on designing, building, and programming an autonomous robot capable of completing a series of complex obstacle challenges as part of the WRO Future Engineers competition. 

Team KMIDS-GFM was inspired by the challenge of applying engineering principles and problem-solving skills to creatively and efficiently solve complex problems. Pushing forward with our passion for innovation and hands-on learning.

Our goal is to design and build a reliable and efficient system that demonstrates our technical and collaborative skills while serving as a learning experience. We followed a systematic process, including brainstorming, researching, prototyping, testing, and iterating. We maintained detailed documentation for ease of knowledge sharing and a smoother workflow throughout the project.

The robot is engineered with a modular chassis, powered by an N20 motor with an encoder, and controlled using a Raspberry Pi 5 and a Raspberry Pi Pico 2. It utilises a combination of an RPLidar C1 LIDAR sensor and a fish-eye lens camera to provide an advanced system for obstacle detection and navigation.

Our objective was to create an intelligent robot that is capable of navigating through obstacles with pinpoint precision and speed.
