## 1. 📖 About the Project

This project was developed as part of the Future Engineers category in the World Robot Olympiad. Our goal was to design, build, and program an autonomous robot capable of completing multiple challenges with efficiency and reliability.

<!-- NOTE: You should add a few paragraphs here about your inspiration, high-level goals, team structure, and overall approach. -->

---

## 2. ⚙️ Mobility Management

<!-- NOTE: Mobility management discussion should cover how the vehicle movements are
managed. What motors are selected, how they are selected and implemented.
A brief discussion regarding the vehicle chassis design /selection can be
provided as well as the mounting of all components to the vehicle
chassis/structure. The discussion may include engineering principles such as
speed, torque, power etc. usage. Building or assembly instructions can be
provided together with 3D CAD files to 3D print parts. -->

### 2.1 Motor Selection
<!-- NOTE: Explain what motors were used, their specifications (torque, RPM, voltage), and why they were chosen. -->

### 2.2 Chassis Design
<!-- NOTE: Describe the chassis design, dimensions, materials, and how components are mounted. -->

### 2.3 Mobility Principles
<!-- NOTE: Discuss speed, gear ratios, torque, differential, turning mechanism, etc. -->

### 2.4 Mounting and Structure
<!-- NOTE: Include how parts are mounted securely and any relevant design files. -->

## 3. 🔋 Power and Sense Management

<!-- NOTE: Power and Sense management discussion should cover the power source for
the vehicle as well as the sensors required to provide the vehicle with
information to negotiate the different challenges. The discussion can include
the reasons for selecting various sensors and how they are being used on the
vehicle together with power consumption. The discussion could include a wiring
diagram with BOM for the vehicle that includes all aspects of professional
wiring diagrams. -->

### 3.1 Power Source
<!-- NOTE: Describe the battery type, voltage, capacity, and reason for selection. -->

### 3.2 Sensors Used
<!-- NOTE: List all sensors (e.g., ultrasonic, gyroscope, camera, light sensor), why they were chosen, and how they're used in the system. -->

### 3.3 Wiring and BOM
<!-- NOTE: Include a wiring diagram, voltage levels, and a Bill of Materials (BOM) with part names, specifications, and suppliers. -->

---

## 4. 🧠 Obstacle Management

<!-- NOTE: Obstacle management discussion should include the strategy for the vehicle to
negotiate the obstacle course for all the challenges. This could include flow
diagrams, pseudo code and source code with detailed comments. -->

### 4.1 Strategy Overview
<!-- NOTE: Explain the logic and steps your robot takes to detect and navigate obstacles. -->

### 4.2 Flowcharts and Pseudo Code
<!-- NOTE: Include diagrams or lists that represent logical flow for obstacle avoidance. -->

### 4.3 Source Code Summary
<!-- NOTE: Describe key code modules related to obstacle management and explain them briefly. -->

---

## 5. 🖼️ Images

<!-- NOTE: Pictures of the team and robot must be provided. The pictures of the robot must
cover all sides of the robot, must be clear, in focus and show aspects of the
mobility, power and sense, and obstacle management. Reference in the
discussion sections 1, 2 and 3 can be made to these pictures. Team photo is
necessary for judges to relate and identify the team during the local and
international competitions. -->

### 5.1 Robot Images
<!-- NOTE: Include clear, high-quality photos from top, bottom, front, back, left, and right. -->

### 5.2 Internal View
<!-- NOTE: Show images of internal layout (wiring, board placement, sensors, motors). -->

### 5.3 Team Photo
<!-- NOTE: Add a team photo with names and roles of each team member. -->

---

## 6. 🎥 Performance Videos

<!-- NOTE: The performance videos must demonstrate the performance of the vehicle from
start to finish for each challenge. The videos could include an overlay of
commentary, titles or animations. The video could also include aspects of
section 1, 2 or 3. -->

### 6.1 Challenge 1 - Open Challenge
[Watch on YouTube](#) <!-- NOTE: Replace with actual video link -->

### 6.2 Challenge 2 - Obstacle Challenge
[Watch on YouTube](#) <!-- NOTE: Replace with actual video link -->

<!-- NOTE: Videos must be at least 30 seconds of continuous autonomous run. You may add overlays and labels. -->

---

## 7. 💻 Source Code

### 7.1 Code Structure
<!-- NOTE: Explain how your codebase is organized (e.g., folders for different challenges or components). -->

### 7.2 Main Code Modules
- Motor Control
- Sensor Input & Processing
- Obstacle Navigation
- Serial Communication (e.g., with camera or sensors)
- Setup and Initialization

### 7.3 Compilation/Upload Instructions
<!-- NOTE: List any software/IDE needed (e.g., Arduino IDE), libraries required, and steps to upload to microcontroller. -->

---

## 8. 🛠️ Build Instructions

### 8.1 3D Printed Parts
<!-- NOTE: Mention parts that are 3D printed. Include .STL files in the repo. -->

### 8.2 Tools and Assembly
<!-- NOTE: Provide brief assembly instructions or a link to a full manual. -->
